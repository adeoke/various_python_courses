This repo will cover a multitude of python courses.

First up, fundamental data types

I also thought I'd add some classic ISEB testing style questions and answers.

For example, 
Questions on branch and statement coverage.

#So what is branch coverage?

Branch coverage covers both ways (true and false). 
It covers all the possible outcomes of each condition at least once. 
Branch coverage is a whitebox testing method that ensures that every
possible branch from each decision point in the code is executed at 
least once. To calculate Branch coverage, find out the minimum number
of paths which ensure covering of all the edges.

#What is statement coverage?

Statement coverage is a whitebox testing technique technique where 
all the statements at the source code are executed at least once.
To calculate Statement Coverage, find out the shortest number of 
paths following which all the nodes will be covered.

#What is Path Coverage?

It is executed in such a way that every path is executed at least once.
It ensures that every statement in the program is guaranteed to be executed
at least one time. Path Coverage ensures covering all the paths from 
beginning to end.
